## Hi there! 👋

🧑‍💻
If you saw me in a PR, probably I was improving some **GitHub Actions Workflows** or optimizing `Dockerfiles`.  
I tend to do so to help people and encourage using automations 😜

Besides that, I do have some research projects and utilities for myself that I want to share with the world,  
so if it helps you feel free to use it. 😊

(If you want to use it for commercial purposes, you may want to hire me as well 😎)
